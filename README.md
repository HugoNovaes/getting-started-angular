# Ironcore Getting Started Angular

## Run in development

### Run server

Run `ng serve -o` to run the dev server and open up a browser window which will navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### A Note on API Keys

This application ships with a pre-generated set of API keys in order to simplify getting started. You can also generate your own API keys to use as well. Just change the configuration within the `./ironcore-config.json` file and replace the existing `./private.key` file with yours.
